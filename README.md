# Project-Euler-Solutions
Code Author: Brandon Byskov

These are my solutions to Project Euler problems. Project Euler is a website that contains many problems that require mathematics and programming skill to solve. They range greatly in their dificulty. The objective of solutions is to solve the problems in a very efficient manner.

This repository contains solutions to problems that I've solved in C++, Haskell, or both languages. I think it's fun to try the problems in imperative and functional languages.

There is a function dedicated to each problem. Each funciton solves the problem in its general form, not only for the specific problem given on Project Euler. Solutions can be tried by calling the functions from the main function. The C++ functions and their inputs for the Project Euler answer can be found in 'Cpp/problem.h'. The Haskell functions and parameters can be found in 'Haskell/src/Euler/Problem.hs'.
